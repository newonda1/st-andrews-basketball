      <p className="mb-4">
        The 2024-2025 season became one of the most memorable chapters in St. Andrew’s basketball history, defined by resilience, redemption, and a return to championship glory. While the early portion of the season brought mixed results, it was the pivotal win over Beach High School that signaled the team’s turning point. From that moment, the team’s chemistry clicked, and the Lions began to play their most confident basketball of the year.

        Midseason challenges tested the group’s resolve. A tough loss to Benedictine, marked by a wide margin, was a humbling moment, and a narrow defeat to New Hampstead — where St. Andrew’s led early before letting the game slip away — was especially painful. But rather than derail the season, these setbacks sparked a new level of determination.

        The Lions never lost again. They closed the season on an extraordinary 15-game winning streak, sweeping through their region schedule and completing a fourth straight undefeated region run — extending their region win streak to an astounding 40 games. Postseason play saw the Lions breeze through the opening rounds, capturing their fourth consecutive region championship with authority.

        In the state semifinals, the Lions faced Lakeview Academy — the very team that had ended their championship hopes the previous year with a heartbreaking last-second overtime shot. This time, St. Andrew’s left no doubt. They executed with poise and intensity, controlling the game from tip to buzzer to avenge last season’s disappointment.

        The state championship matchup against Brookwood was the final test. With a mix of relentless defense, crisp ball movement, and clutch shooting, the Lions surged ahead and never looked back, capturing their third state title in four years. The championship was a testament to the team’s growth, their ability to overcome adversity, and their unwavering commitment to each other.
