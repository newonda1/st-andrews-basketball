          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            The 2025–26 season has been a long, winding run that began with early questions and has
            grown into another deep postseason push. From the first weekend in November through the
            state quarterfinal in Macon, St. Andrew’s has had to find answers in tight finishes,
            respond to midseason setbacks, and carry the weight of high expectations that come with
            the program’s recent history.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            In head coach Mel Abrams’ view, the defining trait of this team has been its evolution.
            “Growth and maturity,” Abrams said. “A new group of leaders with a fairly large group of
            young players who have each grown individually.”
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            The opening stretch set the tone. The Lions began the year with a 50–40 win over Morgan
            County at the Pro Movement Showcase, jumping out to an early lead, giving it up late, and
            then closing the game on an 11–0 run when the outcome was in doubt. A few nights later
            they raced past South Effingham at home, building a 51–18 halftime margin behind a fast
            start on both ends. Even in the first week, Ja’Cari Glover established himself as a
            constant inside presence, stacking double-doubles while the group around him settled into
            new roles.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            The schedule tightened quickly after that first burst of momentum. A loss to Bradwell
            forced the Lions to regroup, and a trip to Hilton Head Island became an early gut check.
            December brought bumps, including close losses that could easily have knocked the season
            off track. Instead, the Lions stayed committed to their daily habits and used those
            non-region games as opportunities to learn from their mistakes. As Abrams notes, “The
            confidence we have on the court comes from our daily habits and the experience and
            feedback we gathered from our non-region schedule.”
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            That steady foundation began to show in the Gray Solana Memorial Game, when St. Andrew’s
            returned home and earned a 66–42 win over Hilton Head Prep. Glover was nearly unstoppable
            inside in that game and has remained a matchup problem for opponents all season long.
            “It’s his physicality and athleticism,” Abrams said. “He plays with a high motor and plays
            much bigger than his actual height.”
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            At the Savannah Christian Christmas Classic, the Lions put together wins over Mount Paran
            and Effingham County and began to settle into a clearer identity — defending with purpose
            and playing with better spacing and patience offensively.
          </p>

          <img
            src="/images/boys/basketball/seasons/2025-26/Season2025_26_2.PNG"
            alt="St. Andrew's boys' basketball action collage"
            className="float-right ml-4 mt-4 mb-3 w-full max-w-sm rounded-lg shadow"
          />

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            Region play turned that identity into a statement. The Lions opened conference action
            with a 68–21 win at Pinewood Christian and never really slowed down. They strung together
            convincing region victories, including a dominant performance at Westminster and a
            90-point outburst on Senior Night against Pinewood. Even on nights when shots were
            inconsistent though, the defensive standard of the team held firm.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            The regular season ended with the Lions holding a 16–6 overall record. St. Andrew’s once
            again finished 8–0 in region play, completing a sixth consecutive undefeated run through
            the region schedule — a level of sustained success Abrams attributes to the broader
            foundation around the program. “To me it speaks to the support of our administration, the
            trust from our parents and the buy in from our players,” he said.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            Individual performances reinforced that success. Glover controlled the paint in big
            moments throughout the year. Chase Brown and Page Getter each had stretches where they
            took over games, the product of an offseason commitment that Abrams believes is now paying
            dividends. “They both made an off-season commitment to get better,” Abrams said. “What
            you’re seeing now is the fruit of that work. They’re playing with confidence, and that
            confidence is a result of the work.”
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            Amari Cook and Milos Copic often impacted games in ways that went beyond the stat sheet.
            “They are the connectors,” Abrams said. “Amari’s ability to generate offense with his
            defense is so valuable. Milos’ ability to facilitate and make plays at his size has been a
            huge benefit.”
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            The postseason has reinforced how far the group has come. St. Andrew’s rolled into the
            region tournament as the top seed, extended its dominance over Pinewood in the semifinals,
            and handled Frederica in the championship to claim a fifth straight region title. The
            victory also delivered Abrams’ 200th career win and marked the program’s 50th consecutive
            victory over region opponents.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            In the state quarterfinal, the Lions once again faced Frederica and found themselves
            trailing at halftime. What followed was one of the defining stretches of the season — a
            30–4 run that flipped the game and secured a 72–55 win, sending St. Andrew’s to its fifth
            consecutive State Final Four.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            Wednesday brings a familiar opponent. This will be the fourth straight year that St.
            Andrew’s and Lakeview Academy meet in the semifinals. On facing Lakeview again, Abrams
            noted, “When you play someone as many times as we have, there is a level of familiarity
            that creates challenges. It becomes similar to playing a region opponent.”
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            The Lions won the matchup in 2023 and 2025, while Lakeview claimed it in 2024. In each of
            the past three seasons, the winner of that game has gone on to win the state championship.
            As for the historical weight surrounding the matchup, Abrams keeps it simple. “Honestly, it
            means nothing. Both teams are different. The approach is still to win and advance.”
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            However this season concludes, Abrams hopes this era will be remembered for more than
            banners. “That we played defense at an elite level and that we played unselfishly on
            offense,” he said. “But more importantly, that as coaches we used the game to impact lives
            and develop high-character, hard-working young men.”
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
            And with that standard in place, the next chapter awaits.
